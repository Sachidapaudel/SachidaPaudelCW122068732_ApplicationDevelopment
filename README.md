The TrackIT project is a prototype desktop application designed for streamlined personal expense tracking. 
It efficiently manages cash inflows (credits), cash outflows (debits), and debts with robust transaction management features. 
The application allows users to categorize transactions, add custom tags, and include optional notes for enhanced organization. 
A comprehensive dashboard provides insights into total inflows, outflows, debts, cleared debts, and pending debts. Users can search, filter, and sort transactions by title, type, tags, or date range.
The advanced debt management system ensures precise tracking of due dates, identifies debt sources, and highlights pending debts for better financial control.
